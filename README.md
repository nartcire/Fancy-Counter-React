 ## Motivation
 
 I wanted to recreate this project to learn how to do the same things that I had previously done with Vanilla JS with React.JS instead!
 
 ## Description
 
 The website is a simple counter that stops at the count of 5. Once the counter hits 5, it will disable the decremenet and incremenet operations until the user presses the reset button. Additionally, the counter will always be nonnegative meaning that the counter will not count below 0.
